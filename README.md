<h3> Annoying Things I Couldn't Get Right (aka Bugs):</h3>

<p> (This stuff is way too fancy for me right now, but the look is definitely almost there) </p>
<ul>
   <li>Opacity of the grid toolbar icon does NOT change when mouse is hovered over, and no drop down menu (I tried "onmouseover" but couldn't work it out) </li>
   <li>Microphone is not situated inside the search bar</li>
   <li>Can't quite attach bottom nav bar to the exact bottom of the website (I know there's a way to do this but I gave up -for now) </li>
   <li>Search bar is not automatically highlighted when page is loaded</li>


</ul>
